A drop-in replacement for the strapi editor.

## What is this?
It's a dead simple, and easy to use drop-in replacement for the built-in strapi WYSIWYG editor. It's build upon the [TipTap editor](https://tiptap.dev/).
It saves as plain HTML, making it easy to use with various frontends.


## Why make this?
The main reason was, that I thought that the built-in WYSIWYG editor in strapi could be better. I needed to support tables and css columns. Another requirement was also make it outputted pure html, and has a nice and easy to user interface. I don't want to keep toggling between editor mode and preview mode, just to see what I'm making.

## Requirements
It's build for Strapi **v4**. 

It has been tested to work with **v4.1.1** and I assume it should keep working with later versions.


## Cool! But how do I use it?
Luckily it's very easy to use. Just follow these instructions:

```
# Install the dependency
npm install strapi-tiptap-editor

# Build the Strapi Admin
npm run build
```

You are now using the new editor!

You can verify it, by looking at the plugins page inside Strapi
